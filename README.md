Optimizing Sepsis Treatment Strategies using Reinforcement Learning

A reinforcement learning (RL) model optimizing treatment strategies for sepsis patients using the MIMIC-III dataset. The RL agent learns to recommend optimal treatment actions (e.g., antibiotics, fluids, vasopressors) based on patient state to maximize survival rates and minimize complications. Gymnasium is used to create a custom environment simulating patient trajectories.
