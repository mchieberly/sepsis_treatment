Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment

A reinforcement learning model to optimize sepsis patient treatment using the MIMIC-III dataset. The RL agent learns to recommend treatment actions based on patient state to maximize survival rates and minimize complications. Gymnasium is used to create a custom environment simulating patient trajectories.
